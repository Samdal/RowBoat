# RowBot

We're a group of friends trying to make a discord bot together. We don't expect anyone to use this, but if you want to, it should be pretty easy to get started. You need a minimal knowledge of python, though.

If you would like to use the bot, visit [this link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=669896811632263168&permissions=8&scope=bot) to add it to your server.


While we recommend you don't, it is also possible to host your own instance of the bot
## How to install and setup your own instance (not recommended)
You need [python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "Download here") for this program to work properly. 
1. Download the project and extract the zip file
2. Install `requirements.txt` with pip
3. Go to the [Discord developer portal](http://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) and make a new application with a bot user. 
4. Make a file called `token.txt` in the same directory as ``main.py``, and paste your own bot token into that file
5. Run `main.py`
6. "enjoy"
