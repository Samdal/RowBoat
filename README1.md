# RowBot

We're a group of friends trying to make a discord bot together. We don't expect anyone to use this, but if you want to, it should be pretty easy to get started. You need a minimal knowledge of python, though.

## Installation
You need [python 3.6.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-365/ "Download here") for this program to work properly. 
1. Download the project and extract the zip file
2. Install `requirements.txt` with pip
3. Go to the [Discord developer portal](http://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) and make a new application with a bot user. 
4. Make a file called `token.txt` in the root directory, and paste your token in that file
5. Run `main.py`
